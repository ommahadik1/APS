### 6.3 Hardware Requirements for AI Traffic Systems

#### 6.3.1 Camera Specifications
- **Resolution (4MP minimum):** Ensures clear images for accurate number plate recognition and violation detail.
- **Frame rate (30fps):** Captures smooth video of fast-moving vehicles to prevent motion blur.
- **Lens (Variable focal length 8-32mm):** Allows remote zoom adjustments for flexible and optimal coverage of target areas.
- **Night vision (IR up to 100m):** Enables 24/7 enforcement by capturing clear footage in complete darkness.
- **Weather protection (IP67 minimum):** Guarantees durability against harsh weather like heavy rain and dust.

#### 6.3.2 Processing Hardware
- **Edge AI processors (NVIDIA Jetson series):** Process video directly at the camera for real-time detection, reducing latency and data transfer costs.
- **RAM (8GB minimum):** Allows for running multiple complex AI models simultaneously for different violation detections.
- **Storage (1TB SSD):** Provides a local buffer to store violation data, preventing evidence loss during network outages.
- **Connectivity (4G/5G modem):** Transmits violation data from the field to the central control system for e-challan generation.

#### 6.3.3 Supporting Infrastructure
- **Power supply (200W with solar backup):** Ensures uninterrupted 24/7 operation, even during grid power failures.
- **Network equipment:** Manages secure data flow at locations with multiple cameras.
- **Mounting systems:** Weatherproof poles provide a stable platform at the optimal height and angle for cameras.
- **Control room setup:** A central station for monitoring feeds, managing data, and overseeing the automated enforcement process.
