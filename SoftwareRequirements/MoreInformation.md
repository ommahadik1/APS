# Software Requirements for AI-Powered Accident Prevention & Traffic Camera System

## 1. Core Software Components

- **Real-Time Operating System or Embedded Linux/Windows**  
  Runs edge devices; connects to central servers.

- **Computer Vision & Deep Learning Algorithms**  
  Vehicle, plate detection/classification (CNNs—YOLOv3/v7, ResNet); behavior/violation analysis; object tracking.

- **Image Processing Libraries**  
  OpenCV or similar for enhancement, normalization, cropping, object focus.

- **Optical Character Recognition (OCR) Engine**  
  Required for ANPR—Tesseract or proprietary for license plate text extraction.

- **Event Detection Logic**  
  AI or rule-based violation triggers; integration with signals and sensors.

## 2. Data Integration and Management

- **Database Management (SQL/NoSQL)**  
  Store violations, images, vehicle and events data, logs.

- **API Integration Modules**  
  For linking to government vehicle databases (VAHAN), payment, police systems.

- **Connectivity/IoT Protocols**  
  TCP/IP, HTTP/HTTPS, MQTT, RTSP for device/server/cloud communications.

## 3. Security and Compliance

- **Data Privacy/Anonymization**  
  Encryption of data at rest/transit; compliance with Indian data laws.

- **User Authentication & Role Control**  
  Admin/police/user access segregation, audit trails.

## 4. Monitoring, Control & Analytics

- **Central Dashboard (Web/App UI)**  
  Live feed viewing, violation records, analytics, status monitoring.

- **Automated Notification & Messaging**  
  SMS/email/notifications to violators, alerts to enforcement.

- **Customizable Report Generation**

## 5. Maintenance and Scalability

- **Over-the-Air (OTA) Updates**  
  Remotely upgrade software, AI models, security patches.

- **Modular/Scalable Architecture**  
  Easily add new cameras, sensors, locations. Cloud and edge compatibility.
